*(Note: This link will be active once the GitHub Pages site is deployed via the new workflow.)*

## 🔍 Overview

NexusMind leverages a **Neo4j graph database** to perform sophisticated scientific reasoning, with graph operations managed within its pipeline stages. It implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to integrate with AI applications like Claude Desktop, providing an Advanced Scientific Reasoning Graph-of-Thoughts (ASR-GoT) framework designed for complex research tasks.

**Key highlights:**
- Process complex scientific queries using graph-based reasoning
- Dynamic confidence scoring with multi-dimensional evaluations 
- Built with modern Python and FastAPI for high performance
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Modular design for extensibility and customization
- Integration with Claude Desktop via MCP protocol
