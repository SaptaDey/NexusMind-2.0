# NexusMind Roadmap

This document outlines potential future development directions for NexusMind.
These are ideas for community contribution and project evolution. Priorities and timelines are subject to change.

## Near-Term Goals

*   **Enhanced Documentation:** Continuously improving user and developer documentation, including more examples and tutorials.
*   **Refinement of Core Stages:** Optimizing existing ASR-GoT stages for performance and accuracy.
*   **Expanded Test Coverage:** Striving for comprehensive test coverage across all modules.

## Medium-Term Goals

*   **UI for Graph Visualization:** Develop a user interface for interactive exploration of knowledge graphs (suggested feature, see `docs/suggested_issues/ui_for_graph_visualization.md` for details).
*   **Integration with Arxiv API:** Enhance evidence gathering by integrating with the Arxiv API (suggested feature, see `docs/suggested_issues/integration_with_arxiv_api.md` for details).
*   **Advanced Configuration Options:** Exploring more granular configuration for stages and parameters.

## Long-Term / Vision

*   **Wider Range of Data Source Integrations:** Connectors for more academic databases, enterprise knowledge bases, etc.
*   **User-Defined Custom Stages via UI:** Allowing users to define or combine stages through a graphical interface.
*   **Collaborative Reasoning:** Features enabling multiple users or agents to contribute to a single reasoning process.
