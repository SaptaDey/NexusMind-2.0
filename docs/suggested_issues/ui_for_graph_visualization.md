**Title:** Feature Request: UI for Graph Visualization

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, interacting with and understanding the knowledge graphs generated by NexusMind is primarily through programmatic access or direct Neo4j browser queries. A dedicated UI would make graph exploration more accessible.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A web-based UI component that can render and allow interaction with the graphs (nodes and relationships) generated by NexusMind. This could leverage existing JavaScript graph visualization libraries (e.g., Vis.js, Cytoscape.js, D3.js).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Continuing to rely on Neo4j Browser or other external tools.

**Additional context**
This would significantly enhance the usability and exploratory power of NexusMind, especially for users who are not deeply familiar with Cypher or graph database internals.
Considerations:
- How to serve this UI (e.g., as part of the FastAPI app or a separate static site).
- How to fetch graph data (e.g., dedicated API endpoints).
