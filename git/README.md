# Graph Processing Library

A Python library for modeling and analyzing graph structures with support for confidence vectors.

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install graph-processing-library
```

## Usage

```python
from graph_elements import Node, Edge
from confidence import ConfidenceVector

# Create nodes and edges, assign confidences...
```
