# Smithery deployment configuration for NexusMind MCP Server

# Version of the Smithery configuration schema (if known, otherwise use a placeholder)
version: '1.0'

# Service definition
service:
  # Name of the service
  name: 'nexusmind-mcp-server'

  # Runtime environment (e.g., python, docker, kubernetes)
  runtime: 'python' # Assuming a Python runtime, adjust if it's deployed via Docker

  # Main entrypoint for the application
  # This might be the command to start the server
  entrypoint: 'python src/asr_got_reimagined/main.py'

  # Build configuration (if applicable)
  build:
    # Command to build the application (e.g., for compiling assets or installing dependencies)
    # command: 'poetry install --no-dev' # Example if using Poetry
    # Or if using requirements.txt:
    # command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
    pass # Placeholder if no specific build command is immediately known

  # Deployment configuration
  deployment:
    # Number of replicas or instances
    replicas: 1

    # Resource allocation (example)
    resources:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: '512Mi'

    # Port the application listens on internally
    # This should align with how the application is configured (e.g., via APP__PORT or default)
    # Smithery might use this to configure load balancers or service discovery.
    port: 8000 # Default port, will be overridden by APP__PORT if set

    # Environment variables to be set for the application
    # Smithery might inject these into the runtime environment.
    environment:
      # Example: APP__PORT: ${ENV_PORT} # Smithery might have its own way to reference external vars
      # Example: LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1" # Common for Python applications in containers
      # Add any other necessary environment variables

  # Health check configuration (example)
  health_check:
    # Path for HTTP health checks
    http_path: '/health'
    # Port for health checks (if different from the main application port)
    # port: 8000 

# Add other sections as needed, for example:
# - databases
# - external_services
# - network_configuration
# - volume_mounts
